It is a programming paradigm in which a problem is considered in terms of objects that interact with each other. 
It involves working with a set of objects that have states and behaviours to organize a program.

Benefits of OOP:
- It helps with organizing code so that it's easy for programmers to think about a problem at a higher level of abstraction.
- It lets programmers write programs in a manner that reduces dependencies, which makes maintenance easier.
- It makes code flexible, easy to understand, and easy to change.

Drawbacks of OOP:
- OO programs are often much larger than the equivalent non-OO programs.
- OOP also doesn't always lead to more efficient code. OOP programs can require more memory, disk space, and  computing power.

Encapsulation describes the idea of bundling or combining the data (state) and the operations (behaviour) that work on that data into a single entity, e.g., an object. The properties of the object hold the state (data), and methods represent behavior.

# 4.
In most OOP languages, encapsulation also refers to restricting access to certain properties and methods; an object only exposes the data and behaviors that other parts of the application need to work. In other words, objects expose a **public interface** for interacting with other objects and keep their implementation details hidden. Thus, other objects can't change the data of an object without going through the proper interface. JavaScript, however, doesn't support access restrictions to methods and properties. There are ways to achieve a degree of access restriction in JavaScript, but they're not perfect.
